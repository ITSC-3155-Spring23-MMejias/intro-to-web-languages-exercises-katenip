    Stuff that helped me:
    https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp - helped me see what you meant by putting the style tag in the head and I was able to use that to define the style of the div 
    also idk if it counts but i got the quote from https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/748628-nothing-in-this-world-is-impossible-to-a-willing-heart
